# `#include <void_pointer.h>`

```cpp
#include <void_pointer.h>

void Example() {
    // Given a pointer to a known type...
    Something* somePointer = new Something();

    // Store it as a void*
    VoidPointer voidPointer = void_pointer(somePointer);

    // Get the void*
    void* ptr = voidPointer->void_ptr();

    // Or cast it back to a known type
    Something* thing = voidPointer->as<Something>();

    // VoidPointer is a std::unique_ptr so it will automatically
    // delete the Something* when it goes out of scope AND it
    // knows how to call the destructor of the type it was created from.
}
```

## What?

A `void*` that knows how to delete itself.

## Why?

I needed a `void*` that knew how to delete itself.

True `void*` pointers are useful for storing pointers to unknown types.

But they come with the down side that you can't call `delete` on them.

This library provides a `void*` that knows how to delete itself.

You must know the type of the pointer when you create it, but after that you can use it as a `void*`.

> _Note: I need this for scenarios when I'm working with true `void*`._  
> _If you have the option of using `std::any`, I recommend trying that instead!_

## How?

```cpp
#include <void_pointer.h>
```

```cpp
// Given a pointer to a known type...
Something* somePointer = new Something();
```

```cpp
// Store it as a VoidPointer
VoidPointer voidPointer = void_pointer(somePointer);

// This is shorthand for:
std::unique_ptr<IVoidPointer> voidPointer = VoidPointers::unique_void_pointer(somePointer);

// Because the VoidPointer is a unique_ptr, it will automatically
// delete the Something* when it goes out of scope
```

```cpp
// If you want a raw pointer instead of a std::unique_ptr
IVoidPointer* voidPointer = new_void_pointer(somePointer);

// This is shorthand for:
IVoidPointer* voidPointer = VoidPointers::new_void_pointer(somePointer);

// It will automatically delete the Something* when explicitly deleted:
delete voidPointer;
```

```cpp
// Get the void*
void* ptr = voidPointer->void_ptr();

// Or cast it back to a known type
Something* thing = voidPointer->as<Something>();
```

```cpp
// To disable memory management:
voidPointer->disable_destruct_on_delete();

// This will prevent the VoidPointer from calling the destructor
// of the underlying pointer.

// To re-enable it:
voidPointer->enable_destruct_on_delete();
```
